# 📝 React Native Todo App (with Draggable Reorder & Dark Mode)

A simple **React Native Todo application** built with:

- ⚛️ [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- 📦 [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for state management
- 🎨 Custom **light/dark theme switcher**
- ✨ [Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) + [Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/) for smooth **drag-and-drop reordering**
- 🎨 [Lucide React Native](https://lucide.dev/) icons (with `react-native-svg`)

---

## 🚀 Features

- Add, toggle, and delete todos
- Drag-and-drop to reorder tasks (active ones stay on top, completed ones sink to the bottom)
- Light/Dark theme toggle with icons 🌙 ☀️
- Global state using Zustand (no Redux boilerplate!)
- Modern folder structure (scalable for larger apps)
